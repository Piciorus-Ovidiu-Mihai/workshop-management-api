# 💻 Workshop Management
This is an application for managing the workshops. I used Windows Presentation Foundation for the client and web services for connecting the client with database in C#.
I made an algorithm for checking the safety of the password. With this application you can add, delete and modify an workshop if you are Admin and if you are a client you can use this application for seeing what workshops will take place.
